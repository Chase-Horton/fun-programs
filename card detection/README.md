# Card Detection
This is a program I wrote as a utility in order to identify card names placed in from of a webcam to track card counting, and give the user the best option. However, I have lost the actual program it was used for, but I still have the most complex part, the card detection. The card detection uses threshold subtraction to find the suit and number with least difference in the image when compared with the **Ground Truth** images.  I also tried out using a CNN, but it was much slower and simply didn't seem to be as effective for a task as simple as identifying cards. Since making this however, I have worked a lot with the  YOLOV5 framework and believe it's speed would likely be comparable if not better than this programs'. 
- If you would like an example of how the threshold subtracting works, you can run **'cardDetection guide.py'**, watch **'Example.mp4'**, or watch an online video at https://youtu.be/zOUiapdzBZA.
